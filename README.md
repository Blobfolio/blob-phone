## Features

blob-phone is primarily concerned with validating and formatting arbitrary telephone numbers in international format (e.g. `+1 201-555-0123`). Along the way it also manages to gather information about a number's:

 * Country
 * Continent
 * Type (e.g. `mobile`, `voip`, etc.)

Other data and formatting features from `libphonenumber` have been stripped out to reduce the library's size. For a more comprehensive implementation of `libphonenumber` written for PHP, take a look at [libphonenumber-for-php](https://github.com/giggsey/libphonenumber-for-php).



## Installation

blob-phone requires:

 * PHP 7.0+
 * [blobfolio/blob-common](https://github.com/Blobfolio/blob-common)
 * [neitanod/forceutf8](https://github.com/neitanod/forceutf8)

Install with Composer:

```bash
composer require "blobfolio/blob-phone:dev-master"
```



## Use

#### Get started

```php
$phone = new blobfolio\phone\phone($phone_number, $country_code='US');
```

The constructor accepts two arguments:

 * (*string*) Phone number (pre-formatted or not);
 * (*string*) (*optional*) ISO country code (suspected); Default: `"US"`

Providing a probable country of origin will help with identification, so is recommended. Otherwise your number may end up on the wrong side of the planet.

blob-phone uses a brute-force technique to identify and format a phone number, prioritizing tests as follows:

 * The country provided;
 * Other countries with the same prefix;
 * Other countries on the same continent;
 * Everywhere else, alphabetically;

#### Check it

```php
if ($phone->is_phone($types=array())) {
    ...
}
```

This method accepts an optional array of types of phone numbers in case you are looking for something specific. Type detection is hit or miss, so if you require high accuracy, you should verify this some other way.

The possible types are:
 * `"fixed"`, i.e. landline
 * `"mobile"`
 * `"pager"`
 * `"personal_number"`
 * `"premium_rate"`, e.g. your favorite party line
 * `"shared_cost"`
 * `"toll_free"`
 * `"voicemail"`
 * `"voip"`, e.g. Google Voice

This method returns `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

#### Pull It

```php
// If you only want the number, you can typecast it:
$formatted = (string) $phone; //+598 9423 1234

// If you want more details:
print_r($phone->get_data());
/*
Array(
    [country] => CA             
    [prefix] => 1               
    [region] => North America   
    [types] => Array(
        [0] => fixed              
        [1] => mobile
    )
    [number] => +1 204-234-5678
)
*/
```

#### All Together Now...

```php
$phone = '1012345678';
$country = 'CN';

$phone = (string) blobfolio\phone\phone($phone, $country);
if (strlen($phone)) {
    echo "Your pretty phone number is: $phone";
}
else {
    echo "I don't think that was right...";
}
```
